# sensory-experiment
This was an experiment to measure whether people perceived certain images passed in front of each other or collided with each other 
when the two images crossed in the same direction. (That is, each image intersected in the middle of the window)
In addition, at the moment of intersection, a sound would play; either a bump or a swooshing sound. 

We studied if cars were more likely to seem as banging, and birds as passing through each other, based on the normal perception
(this is because a bird should be in air, whereas cars are on the ground)
In addition, we studied whether timing of the sound had an effect--we altered the timing very slightly per trial, so as to become
later and later. Ideally, the timing would no longer have any effect.
All of this implementation is contained in 'FinalProjectMar13.m'

We took over 30 data samples, but here I've uploaded just 4. 
We also analyzed and graphed our data using MATLAB. This is contained in 'finalProjData2.m'
